5. breaking down tasks into chunks do help, or to be more generic, knowing what to do helps, this doesnt restrict in any way, knowing that you don't know something and are looking for something (even in vague terms) helps
6. I get distracted easily even with tasks at hand, this is probably because I might actually need a pair of ANC headphones etc
7. cleaning up gives a sense of clarity, this was when I cleaned my google keep
8. prepared egg burrito dish
-- heat pan, put oil, once very hot, put three eggs sunny side up, then wait until its brown underneath, liquidy on top, then break the yolk, put tortilla on top, brush with oil, turn the whole thing upside down, choose your toppings on the fried egg side, anything and everything, cheese tomato works, and then wait for tortilla to get cooked/crunch/fried.

","1.  find something to do after this internship
2. connect with neuroscientists to get more broad area knowledge of that field","1. I am very slow in my implementation, and this is probably because I love encapsulation but I feel that its also because I usually don't plan before coding and face it as it comes. However, I feel that I am getting better than before but there is still a long way to go!

2. I am not focusing on my project at hand, and Owens'  recommendation will indeed go a long way in opening opportunities. A good way to fix this is to at least carry out a K (where K > 0) number of tasks related to my internship daily!

3. I have a lot of ideas and I dont implement them due to shortage of time, for eg. I have all these ideas about creating an NLP module to parse and use all my data but its not going to be easy and I don't know if I will ever make the time to do it.

Copy pasting my keep note without verifying:
1.I find a problem with me, and I think that this might be relevant to others too. and that is, writing your own code feels way better than using someone else' s code, for example I didn't read a lot about the google keep API code and instead took their objects and converted them to 
2. I could start a website for helping with workfromhome issues",,,Yes,"Its 2 AM right now and I had planned to sleep early, I keep postponing my sleep and its resulting in a bad lifestyle especially because I am wasting my precious morning hours.

8. not being able to bend the harmonica or focus on the songs","1. I got frustrated when my second answer was deemed incorrect in google's kickstart and felt dumb and annoyed. Then I vented my anger by playing league. 
-- I would like to change this because in life there will be many ups and downs, many tests of self confidence and patience, I would like to be calm and handle them the way I would like to.
2. I didn't finish the graphalytics task with focus and hence delayed my whole schedule for the day. 
3. I got easily distracted when I opened slack to get the links to the graph datasets sent by osama, because then I went to reply to agniezka and sebastian
",,"1. That trying to change everything all at once is the worst thing to do, incremental sustainable progress goes a long way and pays out in the end.
2. That I should do what I want to do, focus on what I want and that way i solve a lot of problems. No this isnt a negative thing, its to understand what I want, to stop beating about the bush.
3. That I should speak my mind out if something is troubling me, when Andy died to the lava I wanted to speak a few things out and then after 5 minutes I did and it felt better. ","1. That I don't need breaks between tasks. But I am human too and would like to calm down or reward myself before moving on to the next task, I should instead focus on truing to reduce the buffer wait time.

2. That there are things that are not possible in computers. Its either already developed by somebody, in maybe a crude and dead way but nevertheless, people have thought about the same things.

And hence I will go out on a limb here and say that I have no worries! The worry is that I want to sleep earlier, the solution I adopt is to skip a few sections in the form","1. I should not label people, instead I should look inside myself and see why and how whatever they did / say / etc affected me and say that out. The same goes with not telling people that they are the cause of a problem.
2. Saying what I want to say sooner than later

","1. to add deadlines has been added to my keep as significant + urgent, hopefully that should be enough ","1. reading - I have lost the patience

-- use cold packs, stretch i.e. find a stretching routine, use gel, buy get!

3. money controls me - I wont lie, I still make decisions, important? decisions based on money as even for buying the pain relief gel I can't do it, I just cant!
-- can't help it right now as indeed you are short of it, let's earn some and stop living from other peoples' perspective

4. graph neural network - why  am I not going frantic about this field? I was supposed to live and love this? you need to die on this, stop being overly meticulous
-- this is surprising to me too, i really thought that i would go crazy about this, analyse on what's preventing me from harbouring all that motivation, channel more of you into gnns.

5. neuroscience connections - I tried but still couldnt connect with the neuroscience graduate students on linkedin, what's missing?
-- i can't help it right now as i dont know a solution
